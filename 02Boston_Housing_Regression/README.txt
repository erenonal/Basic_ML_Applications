* Importing Boston Dataset from sklearn dataset class.
* Exploring and analyse raw data.
* Doing preprocessing for regression.
* Splitting your dataset into train and test sets (0.7 for train and 0.3 for test).
* Trying Ridge and Lasso Regression models with at least 5 different alpha value for each.
* Evaluating the results of all models and choose the best performing model.
