Decision Tree and XGBoost Algorithm Application with Random Generated Samples: 

* Generating dataset using `make_classification` function in the sklearn.datasets class.
* Generating 10000 samples with 8 features (X) with one label (y). 
* Exploring and analyse raw data.
* Doing preprocessing for classification.
* Splitting your dataset into train and test test (0.7 for train and 0.3 for test).
* Trying Decision Tree and XGBoost Algorithm with different hyperparameters. (Using GridSearchCV)
